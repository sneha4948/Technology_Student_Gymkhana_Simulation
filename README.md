# Technology Students Gymkhana
Gymkhana has a number of sporting amenities, including a badminton court, table
tennis court, a gym, and many others. The availability of resources is one of the key
concerns regarding why people come to this area. Resources are the field and types of
equipment. In particular, uncertainty in a good environment is a major threat to each
and every organization. One such uncertainty is resource utilization. Proper resource
utilization can be extremely beneficial for saving time and the number of users. Like
any other organization in a service-oriented environment, a sports or recreation entity
must also maximize resource utilization in order to maintain user satisfaction and
productivity.
